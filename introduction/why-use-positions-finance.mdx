## Why Use Positions Finance?

Positions Finance is designed for users, protocols, and integrators who need to maximize the utility and productivity of staked, yield-bearing, or otherwise locked assets—without sacrificing rewards or duplicating capital across DeFi.

## Key Advantages

### 1. Composable Collateral, Not Fragmented Capital

- Assets deposited into Positions-enabled vaults instantly become composable collateral: they can be used wherever the protocol is integrated, with no need to unstake, re-wrap, or provide excess liquidity elsewhere.
- Collateral eligibility is maintained in real time. If your balance or yield grows, your borrowing/lending power updates automatically across the ecosystem.

### 2. Continuous Yield with Uninterrupted Liquidity

- Your staked or productive assets do not stop accruing rewards just because you want to access liquidity or margin.
- Positions' design ensures deposited assets always remain productive, and users retain full access to earned rewards for as long as their assets are held—and can simultaneously use these as live collateral.

### 3. Unified Portfolio Health and Real-Time Risk Management

- All collateral, debt, and eligible leverage are tracked via a single, always-updated position profile.
- Users never need to cross-reference multiple contracts, tokens, or dashboards to understand their borrowing, risk, and liquidation status—everything is consolidated.
- Every protocol operation (borrow, leverage, withdraw, repay) validates risk and eligibility using the live system state, so you cannot inadvertently over-borrow or become under-collateralized without protocol intervention and visible alerts.

### 4. Seamless Composability and Integration Potential

- Any DeFi protocol (money market, perps, options, margin clearinghouse) can reference a user’s composable collateral profile, with no additional capital bridges or collateral re-deposits.
- For protocols, this means onboarding more users and liquidity instantly: composable collateral can serve wherever the integration is coded for it—on the native chain first, with planned expansion to cross-chain contexts.

### 5. Permissionless and Transparent

- All eligibility, limits, and health checks operate entirely from on-chain data—no allowlists, approvals, or arbitrary admin checks.
- Risk logic, LTV ratios, and eligibility rules are enforced by the protocol, not hidden away in off-chain or upgradable contracts. All users and integrators can read and verify the rules and their own status at any time.
