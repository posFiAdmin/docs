Why use Positions Finance?
For Users (Retail & DeFi-Native)
Unlock Yield and Liquidity Simultaneously: No more tradeoffs between earning yield in vaults and needing liquid funds for new opportunities. Assets locked with Positions remain productive and instantly available as borrowing collateral.

Composability & Portability: Proof-of-Collateral tracks balances and health in real time; users can access multiple protocols (e.g., borrowing/lending, perps, or cross-chain markets) without ever moving their underlying.

Operational Efficiency: Borrow, leverage, or collateralize instantly without wrapping, bridging, or capital fragmentation. Portfolio exposure is trackable in one place.

For Developers / Protocols
Integrate Credible On-Chain Collateral: Accept Proof-of-Collateral natively as security in your money markets, perpetual venues, or derivative platforms.

Reduce Risk, Increase Liquidity: All collateral is actively yield-bearing. Risk logic and liquidation are managed by Positions, reducing duplicative risk management for integrators.

Cross-Ecosystem Capital Flow: Protocols can tap the cumulative collateral across Berachain apps and other supported chains.

For Investors / Stakeholders
Expanded TAM (Total Addressable Market): Increased capital efficiency draws more user deposits and protocols, leading to a healthier, more networked ecosystem.

Protocol Sustainability: The flywheel of yield + collateral utility attracts sophisticated actors seeking both passive and composable yield.

Proof-of-Collateral: Core Concept
At the technical core, every user’s protocol state—deposits, active loans, and available collateral—is maintained in real time by the Proof-of-Collateral mechanism. Proof-of-Collateral can be presented and verified by other protocols using Positions' relayer network and on-chain proof logic.

How it functions:

When a user deposits assets to a vault, the Proof-of-Collateral is updated to reflect both the principal and the accrued yield.

Any borrowing or leverage events deduct from borrowable collateral in real time.

The Proof-of-Collateral serves as the user’s gateway to initiate borrowing and compose across other protocols that trust Positions’ collateral accounting.

The state is always on-chain, queryable, transparent, and enforceable by protocols and DAOs, not by Position’s centralized logic.
