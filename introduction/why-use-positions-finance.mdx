By abstracting locked and yield-generating positions into composable, portable collateral, Positions Finance lets users participate in multiple DeFi strategies simultaneously with the locked up underlying assets. This increases capital efficiency across the ecosystem and enables a level of protocol integration and productivity not previously possible for staked or locked tokens.

## Key Advantages

### 1. Composable Collateral, Not Fragmented Capital

- Assets deposited into Positions-enabled vaults instantly become composable collateral: they can be used wherever the Positions' PoC is integrated, with no need to unstake, re-wrap, bridge, or provide excess liquidity elsewhere.
- Collateral eligibility is maintained in real time. If your balance or yield grows, your borrowing/lending power updates automatically across the ecosystem.

### 2. Continuous Yield with Uninterrupted Liquidity

- Your staked or productive assets do not stop accruing rewards just because you want to access liquidity or margin.
- Positions' design ensures deposited assets always remain productive, and users retain full access to earned rewards for as long as their assets are held—and can simultaneously use these as live collateral.

### 3. Unified Portfolio Health and Real-Time Risk Management

- All collateral, debt, and eligible leverage are tracked via a single, always-updated position profile, i.e., Proof-of-Collateral.
- Users never need to cross-reference multiple contracts, tokens, or dashboards to understand their borrowing, risk, and liquidation status—everything is consolidated.
- Every protocol operation (borrow, leverage, withdraw, repay) validates risk and eligibility using the live system state, so you cannot inadvertently over-borrow or become under-collateralized without protocol intervention and visible alerts.

### 4. Seamless Composability and Integration Potential

- Any DeFi protocol (money market, perps, options, margin clearinghouse) can reference a user’s composable collateral profile, with no additional capital bridges or collateral re-deposits.
- For protocols, this means onboarding more users and liquidity instantly: composable collateral can serve wherever the integration is coded for it across multiple chains, with base infrastructure layed on Berachain.

### 5. Permissionless and Transparent

- All eligibility, limits, and health checks operate entirely from on-chain data with off-chain relayers—no allowlists, approvals, or arbitrary admin checks.
- Risk logic, LTV ratios, and eligibility rules are enforced by the protocol, not hidden away in off-chain or upgradable contracts. All users and integrators can read and verify the rules and their own status at any time.
