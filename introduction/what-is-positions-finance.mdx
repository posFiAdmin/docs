## Overview

Positions Finance is a composable collateral protocol. Its primary function is to enable users to turn yield-generating, staking, or otherwise locked assets into on-chain collateral that is usable across a broad range of DeFi applications—without interrupting yield or requiring asset transfers, wrapping, or duplication.

## Core Innovation: Proof-of-Collateral

The core of Positions Finance is the Proof-of-Collateral mechanism. This formally records a user's on-protocol positions (deposits, yield balances, open debts, and collateral availability) in a single, dynamic on-chain primitive. Users retain full exposure to staking or vault rewards, while this same locked principal is recognized as collateral—enabling borrowing and composability across multiple protocols and chains without redundant asset transfers/bridging, wrapping, or idle capital.

## How It Works

From a user's perspective, interacting with Positions Finance means:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Deposit Assets">
    Supply your tokens to vaults or liquidity pools (e.g., Berachain Reward Vaults) to start earning.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Retain Yield">
    Continue earning rewards or yield on your deposited positions without interruptions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Translate value into your Proof-of-Collateral">
    Receive a Proof-of-Collateral that represents your staked or deposited position
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use as Collateral">
    Use your collateral across integrated DeFi apps — with live tracking of your collateralization and debt levels.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Borrow, Loop, or Leverage">
    Simply Borrow liquidity on Positions's Lend/Borrow Market or deploy advanced strategies like looping for yield, or leveraging on perps — all backed by your active collateral.
  </Step>
</Steps>

By abstracting locked and yield-generating positions into composable, portable collateral, Positions Finance lets users participate in multiple DeFi strategies simultaneously with the same underlying assets. This increases capital efficiency across the ecosystem and enables a level of protocol integration and productivity not previously possible for staked or locked tokens.
