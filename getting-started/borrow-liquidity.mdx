### Risk Management

- Keep your **Health Factor** above 1.1 for safety
- Use the **Portfolio** tab to monitor your positions

### Borrow Example

If you staked \$1,000 worth of `WBERA-iBERA` into Infrared Vault (LTV 70%):

- You can borrow up to **\$700**
- Borrowing \$500 in USDC will cost:
  - **0.1% Opening Fee** = \$0.50
  - **Borrow APY** (assume 12%) applies until repaid
- You can repay this loan anytime by heading over to **Portfolio** section.
