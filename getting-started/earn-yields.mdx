You can earn passive yields by **supplying assets to the Lend/Borrow market**. These assets not only earn interest from borrowers but also serve as **collateral**—letting you later borrow, loop, or leverage without moving funds.

### Step 1: Go to the Lending Page

Navigate to: https://beta.positions.finance/lend-borrow

Here, you'll see all available markets where you can:

- Supply assets
- See real-time **Supply APY**
- Track pool utilization rates

### Step 2: Deposit an Asset

1. Connect your wallet
2. Select an asset (e.g., `HONEY`, `WBERA`, `USDC`etc.)
3. Click **Deposit**
4. Enter the amount and confirm the transaction

Once confirmed:

- Your assets are deposited into the lending pool
- You **begin earning interest immediately**
- Your position is tracked under **Portfolio → Supply**

### How Yields \+ Collateral Work

- The **Lending APY** comes from borrowers who pay to borrow the assets you lend.
- Interest is distributed **pro-rata** to all lenders.
- You also **unlock collateral value** to borrow against
- The rate is dynamic and depends on **utilization** (higher borrowing = higher yield).

### What You Can Do Next

After supplying:

- Borrow from your available collateral
- Loop your position for amplified yields
- Track interest and collateral health under **Portfolio**
- Withdraw anytime, subject to pool liquidity

<Warning>
  **Tip**: High utilization or low liquidity may temporarily restrict instant withdrawals — plan accordingly.
