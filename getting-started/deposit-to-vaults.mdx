### Step 1: Connect Your Wallet

- Head to http://beta.positions.finance/
- Click **Connect Wallet** at the top right.
- Make sure you're on the correct network (e.g., **Berachain**).

### Step 2: Choose a Vault

Youâ€™ll see several vault protocols like, **Berachain Reward Vaults (BeraHub)**, **Infrared Finance** Vault, and more.

1. Select and scroll the pairs in the vaults.
2. Find your asset pair (e.g., `WBERA-iBERA` under Infrared Finance)
3. Click **Stake** on the vault of your choice.

ðŸ“Œ **Important:**

- You must have the asset (e.g., `WBERA-iBERA`) in your wallet.
- If you don't, you'll need to provide liquidity elsewhere (e.g., Kodiak Finance, BEX, etc.) before trying to stake on vaults.

<Tip>
  Tip: Use vaults like `WBERA-iBERA` if you're planning to borrow BERA later. The higher the APR and LTV, the more flexibility youâ€™ll have. Also the price action of the borrowing assets follows the underlying collateral asset.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Confirm & Stake

- Once the staking modal opens, enter the amount you wish to deposit.
- Approve the asset if itâ€™s your first time.
- Confirm the **Stake** transaction in your wallet.

Once staked:

- Youâ€™ll start earning yield
- Your Proof-of-Collateral (PoC) is updated instantly
- You can borrow against this collateral from the **Lend/Borrow** section

To view and manage this, head to the **Portfolio** tab.

**Note on Fees**:\
Positions Finance charges a **5% protocol fee on the rewards earned**. It is applied only on the _yield accrued_, not your principal.

### Notes for Users

- **Infrared Vaults** also earn you **Infrared Points** on top of the base yield. These might later be used for rewards or governance.
- **APR can fluctuate** based on vault performance and usage.
- Depositing to vaults **locks your tokens**, but they remain withdrawable unless used as collateral for borrowing or loops.
- Vault positions contribute to your **collateral value** for borrowing. You can view/manage this under the **Portfolio** tab.

### To Unstake

- Navigate back to the vault page.
- Click **Unstake** next to your active position.
- Confirm the transaction in your wallet.
