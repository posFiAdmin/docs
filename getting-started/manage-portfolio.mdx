The **Portfolio Dashboard** is your command center on Positions. It gives you real-time insights into deposits, borrowings, net APY, health factor, and Proof-of-Collateral‚Äîall in one place.

### a. Open the Portfolio Tab

Go to: https://beta.positions.finance/portfolio/

Here, you‚Äôll see:

- **Current Balance:** Total value across all deposits and borrowings.
- **Total Deposits:** Combined value from Vaults and Lending Pools.
- **Total Borrowings:** All active borrow positions (Borrowing \+ Looping).
- **Net APY:** Your overall performance (positive or negative) after fees.
- **Portfolio LTV:** Weighted Loan-to-value ratio across all collateral.
- **Health Factor:** A live indicator of risk level (color-coded meter).

<Info>
  A Health Factor **below 1.0** means you are eligible for liquidation. Try to stay **above 1.5** for safety.
</Info>

### b. Track Your Deposits

Under **Your Deposits**, you'll see:

- Which vaults and lending pools your assets are in.
- Asset names and source vaults (e.g., _Infrared Finance_, _Berachain Reward Vaults_).
- The APY you're earning.
- Claimable rewards per position.

**Example:**\
In your dashboard:

- You‚Äôve staked **iBERA-wBERA** in Berachain Reward Vaults at **18.89% APY**.
- You‚Äôve also staked **WBERA-iBERA** in Infrared at **4.5% APY**.

Use the **Claim Reward** button to collect yields manually. Or use **Unstake** to remove assets when needed (if not locked or being used as collateral).

### c. Track your Borrowings

Under **Your Borrowings**, view:

- The assets you‚Äôve borrowed.
- The amount borrowed.
- The interest accured from borrowed liquidity.
- Options to repay or unwind via the **Repay** path.

üí° Notes: Borrowed assets count against your Health Factor, so track closely.

### d. Monitor and Adjust

Use the dashboard to:

- **Track overall performance** (Net APY may go negative if borrow rates exceed earn rates).
- **Avoid liquidation risks** by repaying, withdrawing excess borrow, or adding more collateral.
- **Check your PoC (Proof-of-Collateral)** status directly from the dashboard or click **‚ÄúView more on PoC‚Äù**.
