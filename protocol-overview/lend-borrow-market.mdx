Positions' Money Market is the primary venue for collateral utility within Positions Finance, turning productive vault positions into immediate liquidity.

- **Lending:** Users can supply assets to the protocol to simply earn competetive interest generated by borrower demand and usage of the system.
- **Borrowing:** Collateral tracked by PoC is instantly eligible to secure loans. Borrow and risk limits are set algorithmically according to protocol-wide safety parameters and live collateral values (as referenced in PoC).
- **Key features:**
  - All interest, repayments, and risk triggers are automated and linked directly to each user’s state.
  - Asset withdrawals and borrows are both guarded by immediate health checks using up-to-date PoC data.

### How It Works

1. **Request & Risk Checks**
   - Users initiate borrow or lend transactions via market contracts.
   - Before any action is finalized (borrow, withdraw, repay), the contract checks the user’s PoC record for up-to-date collateral, yield, borrow status, and health factor.
2. **Automated Interest & Risk Enforcement**
   - Interest on borrows accrues at protocol-defined rates and is accounted for in PoC on a rolling basis.
   - Protocol only allows new borrows or withdrawals if they’ll keep you within safety margins; otherwise, the operation is instantly blocked.
3. **Liquidation Protection**
   - If debt or market movements put your health factor below safe limits, the protocol enables anyone (incl. “keeper” bots) to trigger repayment/liquidation, using your available on-chain collateral.
4. **Audit Trails & Integration**
   - All lending/borrowing actions and risk state changes emit events for external analytics, dashboards, and integrators.
   - Lenders and integrators can always verify their risk by querying user PoC states.

**In Summary:**\
Lend/Borrow Markets convert productive collateral into working liquidity, always safeguarded by live PoC risk checks.
