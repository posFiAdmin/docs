Proof-of-Collateral, a ERC 721 NFT is the user's on-chain accounting system and the backbone of composable collateralization. It continuously tracks, for every user:

- Total vault deposits and their types,
- Accrued (but not yet claimed) yield,
- Any outstanding borrowing or leveraged positions,
- The real-time net collateral eligible for new activity.

**Key functions:**

- **State engine:** All borrow, repay, withdraw, or leverage actions are instantly reconciled and validated via the PoC system. Users can never become “over-collateralized” due to stale data, and the protocol can enforce liquidation or risk caps with precision.
- **Composability point:**
  - PoC acts as the single source of truth for anyone in the wider DeFi ecosystem wanting to verify a user’s collateral state.
  - Partner protocols (on Berachain or, via relayer, on other chains) can reference PoC state to accept users’ positions as collateral—with no need for additional bridges or token wrappers.

### How It Works

1. **Live State Tracking**
   - On every deposit, withdrawal, yield event, borrow, or repay, PoC state is updated immediately via contract calls or emitted events.
   - PoC holds: asset balances, yield, outstanding borrows, and a computed health factor for every user.
2. **Core Logic for Eligibility & Risk**
   - All maximum borrow limits, withdrawal safety checks, and liquidation triggers are enforced using your current PoC state—no operation proceeds if it would make your account unsafe.
   - All actions across the protocol (even from different apps or integrations) funnel through PoC (with relayers), guaranteeing no “side channel” or hidden risk buildup.
3. **External Integration & Composability**
   - Protocols inside and outside Positions can programmatically integrate PoC—via relayer sync—for real-time collateral eligibility.
4. **Atomic Security**
   - Any update to PoC is either fully completed (commit) or reverts if it fails any check—ensuring integrity even in the face of errors, rapid price changes, or relay lags.
   - Liquidations, risk checks, and withdrawals always use the live PoC, never stale data.

**In Summary:**\
PoC is the protocol’s core accounting and control layer—a canonical, atomic record of all collateral and risk.
