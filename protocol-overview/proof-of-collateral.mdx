## How It Works

## 1. Real-Time State Tracking

- Whenever you deposit, withdraw, generate yield, borrow, or repay, those actions immediately update your PoC via direct contract calls or event-driven state changes.
- The PoC object contains, for each account:
  - Collateral (per asset type and value)
  - Yield owed or accrued
  - Active borrows and interest
  - Calculated health factor and available borrowing/leverage power

## 2. Central Logic for All Protocol Operations

- All protocol rules—such as maximum borrow amounts, withdrawal limits, and liquidation triggers—are checked by referencing your current PoC state.
- You cannot circumvent risk controls by acting through different contracts, as all operations consolidate to your live PoC record.

## 3. External Queries and Composability

- Any integrated protocol (on the native chain or cross-chain via relayer infrastructure) can query the PoC to validate collateral balances, debt levels, or yield—providing seamless composability for margin, lending, trading, or other DeFi activities.
- There’s no need for additional proofs or off-chain trust; the PoC is a permissionless “oracle” for your position health.

## 4. Security and Precision

- All PoC updates either finalize or revert atomically with their underlying operation. This ensures that deposition, borrowing, and withdrawal cannot drift or desynchronize with position eligibility.
- System risk checks are tied entirely to PoC: liquidation is fast, accurate, and only ever impacts the affected user’s positions.

In summary:\
Positions Finance, powered by its Proof-of-Collateral system, enables productive assets to serve as live, composable collateral wherever DeFi integration is possible. Eligibility, risk, and operations are determined solely by real, protocol-driven, up-to-date asset tracking—making capital use efficient, portable, and secure for all ecosystem participants.
